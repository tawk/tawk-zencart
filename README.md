## Installation
1. Extract the zip file.
2. Copy the contents of the `YOUR_ADMIN_FOLDER` to `<ZENCART_INSTALLATION>`/`<YOUR_ADMIN_FOLDER>`
3. Copy the contents of the `includes`/`templates`/`YOUR_TEMPLATE` to `<ZENCART_INSTALLATION>`/`includes`/`templates`/`<YOUR_CURRENT_TEMPLATE>`.
4. Copy the other contents of the `includes` folder to `<ZENCART_INSTALLATION>`/`includes`.

NOTE: If you don't know what the template directory name you are using, then you can find it out by following these steps:
1. Go to `Dashboard` -> `Tools` -> `Template Selection`.
2. From the screen that shows `Template Selection`, look under the column that is titled `Template Directory`. You can find the name of your template directory that your Zen Cart site is currently using. That `EXACT` name is the one that you will use to replace each instance of `<YOUR_CURRENT_TEMPLATE>`.
